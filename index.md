I am an **engineering leader**, **manager** and **software engineer**. I work on solving complex problems in the field of data engineering and help develop massive distributed systems, data pipelines, platform & services. I currently lead a team of Data Engineers building Realtime Data Platform at <a href="https://wwww.activisionblizzard.com">Activision Blizzard</a>.

I recieved my **Masters** in Computing Science from <a href="https://www.sfu.ca/">Simon Fraser University</a>. 

This website is my personal space where I plan to share stories, thoughts, lessons and experiments from my personal & professional experiences.
